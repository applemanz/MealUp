<P> MealUp is a mobile app that helps Princeton students schedule meals with their friends. Each user inputs their availability for meals over the next week and will find a time that works for everyone by matching the available times of the users. Users can easily keep track of who they plan to eat with for the week and easily request meals with friends and groups of friends through a user-friendly interface. The app supports Facebook login and imports Facebook friends for the userâ€™s convenience.

<P> MealUp is available for download on the App Store for iOS (versions 9.0 and later) and the Google
Play store for Android (versions 4.4 and later).
